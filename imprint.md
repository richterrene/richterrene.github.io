We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.

### Notice of the Controller

Responsible party for all contents and data processing on this website:

René Richter  
richter.rene[at]gmx.net

Responsible party refers to the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (such as names, email addresses, etc.). Unless a specific storage period is mentioned within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer exists. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent for data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (such as tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will occur after the expiration of these reasons.

## General notes
If you have given your consent to data processing, we will process your personal data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data are processed under Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR. In the case of express consent to the transmission of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), data processing will additionally be carried out on the basis of § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent is revocable at any time. If your data is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we will process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we will process your data if necessary to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.

The relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.

### Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries
We use tools from companies based in the USA or other countries that are not safe in terms of data protection. If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to and processed in these third countries. Please note that these countries cannot guarantee a level of data protection comparable to that of the EU. For example, US companies are required to disclose personal data to security authorities without you as the data subject being able to take legal action against this. It cannot therefore be ruled out that US authorities (such as intelligence agencies) will process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no control over these processing activities.

### Revocation of your consent to data processing 
Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The lawfulness of data processing prior to the revocation is not affected by the revocation.

### Right to object to data collection in special cases as well as to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR): 
If data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f GDPR, you have the right at any time, for reasons that arise from your particular situation, to object to the processing of your personal data, including profiling based on these provisions. ...

### Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement. This right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.

### Right to data portability
You have the right to receive the personal data that we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract, in a commonly used, machine-readable format, and to have that data transmitted to another controller where technically feasible. If you request direct transmission of the data to another controller, this will only be done if technically feasible.

### Access, correction, and deletion rights
You have the right to obtain, free of charge, information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing. You also have the right to request the correction or deletion of this data in accordance with applicable legal requirements. You may contact us at any time regarding questions or concerns about your personal data.

### Right to restriction of processing
You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You may contact us at any time regarding this right. The right to restrict processing applies in the following cases:

- If you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. During the verification period, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
- If the processing of your personal data is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
- If we no longer need your personal data, but you require it to exercise, defend, or establish legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
- If you have objected to processing of your personal data under Article 21(1) of the GDPR, an assessment of interests must be made between your interests and ours. Until it is determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
- If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, except for storage, these data may only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.
