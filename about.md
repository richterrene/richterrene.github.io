![My helpful screenshot]({{ "/assets/rage.png" | absolute_url }})

I'm a Software Developer at [AutoScout24 GmbH](https://www.autoscout24.de) in Munich/Germany.

Starting around 2005 With C# and working with the Microsoft stack for almost 8 years,
I fell in love with Android in 2013 and have been possessed with the world of Mobile
ever since.

Any language will do.
