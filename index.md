Hi there

I'm a fullstack software engineer based in Munich/Germany, starting my professional career in 2005 after falling in love with computers in the late Eighties, with the Robotron KC 87 being the first machine I was able to get hold of.

Since that time, I've been fascinated by technology, developing software since around 2000 and working with a lot of different languages, platforms and technologies, including modern web development, Android apps and backend services.

Favorite languages and frameworks:
